Iñupiaq input method with postfix modifiers. This package supports the
North Slope and Northwest Arctic alphabet, the Seward Peninsula, and
the Canadian Iñupiaq alphabet.

The following key sequences are recognized (as well as lowercase
versions):

  - =G. → Ġ=
  - =L. → Ḷ=
  - =L/ → Ł=
  - =L./ → Ł̣=
  - =L/. → Ł̣=
  - =N~ → Ñ=
  - =N, → Ŋ=
  - =R^ → R̂=

Doubling the postfix separates the letter and postfix: e.g. =g.. →
g.=.
